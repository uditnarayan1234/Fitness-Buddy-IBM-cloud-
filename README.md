## Title:
## Fitness Buddy AI – Your Virtual Fitness Coach
The Challenge:
In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain consistent fitness routines due to lack of guidance, motivation, or access to personal trainers. Traditional fitness apps often lack real-time interaction and personalization, making them less engaging and effective for long-term use.

## The Solution:
Fitness Buddy AI is an intelligent chatbot designed to act as a personal virtual fitness coach. It offers tailored workout routines, nutrition suggestions, motivational support, and real-time Q&A capabilities. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, the chatbot understands user goals, preferences, and fitness levels to deliver interactive, personalized, and goal-oriented advice.
